# AVOE core components

## Overview
The core source for AVOE, and direct successor to auv-hub.


## TODO
- robust message encoder and decoder
- functional and quick sensor data gathering
- robust raw motor control


## Important Files
### main.cpp
Includes all other header files and provides important functions for general vehicle control. The 'test()' function should be the only place where hardcoded elements are permitted. Also handles command line arguments. 




## Motors and Sensors
There are two classes `sensor_t` and `motor_t`, each of these classes contain properties and values for sensor and motor drivers. They directly interface with these drivers through the `sensors.h` and `motors.h` header files. Ideally, sensors and motors are described in the Vehicle Description file and functions are written to translate these hardware specific drivers into universal `sensor_t` and `motor_t` objects automatically by avoe-tool. The `sensor_t` and `motor_t` objects then interface with the "skeleton", currently not formalized, which contains hard coded functions for driving the robot.

### Sensor/Motor Properties
- Model
- Vendor/Manufacture
- Communication Protocol
- Type
- Relative Position
This may change as more implementation occurs. `motor_t` may have a property specifying output force, torque, etc.

## `vehicle_t`

Like the `sensor_t` and `motor_t` classes, `vehicle_t` is a class that contains properties for the target vehicle in a respective AVOE codebase. 
### Properties
- Name
- Version
- Type
- Sensor Count
- Motor Count
