# `sensor_t` helper functions for all sensor types
These are functions that translate useable sensor data of non string types (floats, int, bools, etc. ) into strings that can be stored in 'sensor_t' objects' data fields. Other parts of AVOE will call these functions in order to access retrieve data from `sensor_t` objects.


## Planned sensors for AUV applications
- dummy reference driver
- IMU
- Pressure
- Leak
- Sonar
